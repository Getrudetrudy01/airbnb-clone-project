# 🧠 Technology Stack

The Airbnb Clone Project is built using a collection of modern tools and frameworks that work together to deliver a scalable, secure, and high-performing application. Each technology in the stack plays a specific role in achieving these goals.

🐍 Django

A high-level Python web framework used for building robust, maintainable, and secure web applications.
In this project, Django handles the backend logic, routing, user authentication, and API integration while following the Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture.

🗃️ MySQL

A powerful relational database management system (RDBMS) used to store and manage application data.
MySQL ensures data integrity, relational mapping, and high performance for user profiles, listings, reservations, and payment records.

🔗 GraphQL

An advanced query language for APIs that provides clients with the ability to request specific data.
GraphQL improves efficiency by minimizing over-fetching and under-fetching, offering flexibility when querying data across listings, users, and bookings.

🐳 Docker

A containerization platform that allows applications and dependencies to run consistently across multiple environments.
Docker is used to containerize the Airbnb Clone application, simplifying development, testing, and deployment.

⚙️ Git & GitHub

A version control system (Git) and a collaboration platform (GitHub) used for managing source code, version tracking, and team collaboration.
They support efficient teamwork, issue tracking, and CI/CD integrations.

🚀 GitHub Actions

An automation tool integrated into GitHub that enables CI/CD workflows.
GitHub Actions automates testing, building, and deploying the Airbnb Clone, ensuring reliability and reducing manual effort.

☁️ Cloud Deployment (AWS / Render / Heroku)

A cloud hosting environment used to deploy the application and make it accessible to end users.
This ensures scalability, performance, and continuous availability of the Airbnb Clone web platform.

🔒 API Security Tools

Includes libraries and middleware for implementing authentication (JWT, OAuth2), data validation, and encryption.
These ensure that all communication between the client and server remains private and tamper-proof.
