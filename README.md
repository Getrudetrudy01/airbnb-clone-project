# Airbnb Clone Project

# Overview

The Airbnb Clone Project is a full-stack web application designed to replicate the core functionality of Airbnb — a global online marketplace for lodging and travel experiences. This project serves as a hands-on learning experience in designing, developing, and deploying a scalable booking platform. It emphasizes backend architecture, database modeling, API design, and modern DevOps practices.

# Project Goals

The main objectives of this project are to:

 Develop a robust backend system capable of handling complex booking workflows.

Strengthen understanding of relational database design and optimization.

Implement secure and efficient RESTful API endpoints.

 Apply collaborative software engineering practices using GitHub and CI/CD tools.

 Integrate multiple technologies to create a seamless and scalable application experience.

# Tech Stack

This project leverages a combination of modern technologies, including:

 Backend Framework: Django (Python)

 Database: MySQL

 API Development: Django REST Framework / GraphQL

 Version Control: Git & GitHub

 Containerization: Docker

 CI/CD: GitHub Actions

 Deployment Environment: Cloud-based (e.g., AWS, Heroku, or Render)

Would you like me to add badges (like build status, license, or tech stack icons) and a table of contents next — or do you prefer we first move on to the next task (like team role documentation)?
